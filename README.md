# Project_1_battleship_game

 I will be working on the game BattleShip. This game requires two players, each player will have a set amount of pieces(ships) they are assigned, they will then place their game pieces on the game board. Each player will battle one another on a turn based system, each turn the player will choose alocation of the gameboard to attack. once a player has attacked every location holding another players ships, that player will be determined the winner.
 
 Goals : Create a turn based game between two players
         Create a gameboard
         Ability for each player to set their ships anywhere on the gameboard
         Ability for each player when it is their turn, to choose a location to attack.
         Creating a functionality that tracks a log of illustrating which locations the user has attacked (differintiating between a "hit/miss"
         creating conditions for both a win and a loss, for each player
         creat a prompt for player name
         
         
Stretch Goals: Create AI properties for computer player
                Allow for user to input size they want for the gameboard, to determine difficulty of computer(AI) opponent
